This Twine narrative is meant to explore the real-life trajectory of most young noblemen especially during the Tudor period as during this time a large amount of wars were carried out by Britain against neighboring European powers. Within this narrative the player finds themselves playing the part of a nobleman during one of these such wars where one of the few options for men of that status was to go to war especially if they were unmarried. The player is able to make different decisions that allow them to either avoid being sent to war or be sent out anyway. While these two options may seem simple there are varying levels of success for them, especially the option of going to war as based on the players decisions they can either be sent out on a positive note or on a negative one. This specific spectrum for that decision is meant to resemble how older noblemen especially viewed their younger sons as this was a time period where children were expected to obey their parents without question or be severely punished. While in this narrative the player is meant to portray a nobleman around his early 20s it still serves to show the seriousness with which children, rich or not, of that era were meant to view and obey their parents.
